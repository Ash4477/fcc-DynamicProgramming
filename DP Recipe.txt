Memoization Recipe
    1. Make it work! (Create a simple solution / brute force it)
        -> visualize problem as tree
        -> implement the tree using recursion
        -> test it
    2. Make it efficient!
        -> add a memo object
        -> add a base case to return memo values
        -> store return values in memo

Tabulation Recipe
    -> visualize problem as a table
    -> size the table based on the inputs
    -> initialize the table with default values
    -> seed the trivial answer into the table (e.g. fib[0] and fib[1] and gridTaveler[1,1])
    -> iterate through the table
    -> fill further positions based on current position
